# Find-Ride-App/Webapp
Introducing a new platform to book a cab, auto, rickshaw, toto or any other passenger carrying vehicle.
# Working: 
1.	It is a web app and an app. It will contain 2 buttons named Check and Drivers. 
2.	If clicked on Check, the page will show the list of auto, rickshaw, Toto and taxi drivers within the radius of 3 km.
3.	If clicked on Drivers, a page containing buttons having New Registrations and Existing Members will appear.
4.	If clicked on New Registrations, the drivers will be given a platform to enter their details and register themselves.
5.	For Existing members, they will be given an option to update their location.
6.	The GPS location of the user will be tracked and using the Great Distance formula we will find out all the nearby registered drivers with their name, phone numbers and other required details with an option to call.
7.	 The users can directly call them and talk to them as they usually do offline.
8.	The listing will be done using the LJF (Longest Job First) algorithm so that all the drivers get an equal chance.
9.	The drivers not having any android mobile will give their home location as their permanent location.

# Facilities: 
## USER’s Perspective
1.	There are places where we don’t have the facility of online cab booking. For example, we have the facilities of OLA and UBER in BBSR but in Puri the option is unavailable. Not only in one place but in maximum villages the facility of online booking of cab, auto or rickshaw is not available. The app mainly targets those places.
2.	In OLA and Uber, the price is fixed and there cannot be any negotiation for the travellers and the auto drivers. This web app/app lets it happen.
3.	The web app/app is easy to use than any other app as it doesn’t use any kind of app to be installed in the mobile. The only thing required is an internet connection (works in lower bandwidth as well).

## Driver’s Perspective
1.	The app can be deployed for taxi, rickshaw, Toto, auto or any other kind of vehicle that can carry passengers. Thus, the drivers who are not working under any online cab booking environment can easily double their income using the app.
2.	In any private online cab booking company, a part of the money earned has to be sent to the company. Using this app, drivers can directly connect the passengers. Thus, the money earned only goes to the driver’s pocket.
3.	There are Auto unions that does not allow the drivers to use the online platforms. Using this app, the passengers can directly call the drivers. Thus, avoiding the problem of Unions.

Overall both the customers and the drivers can feel like they are using the services offline.

# Business Plan: 
1.	The registration of the drivers will be done online with proper details (no KYC).
2.	All the auto stands in the villages will be notified by us offline. From every auto stand or union 1-2 persons will be called in a workshop conducted by us. From this workshop, they will come to know the exact proceedings and guide. From them, all the auto drivers from the union will come to know about the product. 
3.	We will have a customer care service open for all the queries.
4.	The promotion will be done through different functions which are organised in villages or through any other mass gathering so that more and more people come to know about the application.
5.	The application does not require much of money but the only thing required is promotion in rural areas.
